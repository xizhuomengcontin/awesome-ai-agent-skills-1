# Contributing to Awesome AI Agent Skills

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This guide will help you create and submit high-quality skills.

## Before You Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ installed
- Git installed
- A GitHub account

### Setup

1. Fork this repository
2. Clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/awesome-ai-agent-skills.git
   cd awesome-ai-agent-skills
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Creating a New Skill

### Canonical Files and Generated Files

This repository supports both Claude Code and OpenAI Codex from the same canonical skills:

- `skills/<skill-name>/` is the only place to author or edit skill content.
- `plugin-groups.json` is the only place to decide which installable plugin bundle owns a skill.
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`, `plugins/**`, and generated README tables are produced by `npm run sync`.
- Do not edit `plugins/<plugin-name>/skills/**` directly. Those folders are Codex package copies and will be overwritten.
- A skill should appear in exactly one plugin group. If two skills overlap, merge the unique content into one canonical `skills/<skill-name>/` folder instead of publishing both.

### Step 1: Create Skill Folder

Create a new folder in `skills/` with your skill name (use kebab-case):

```bash
mkdir -p skills/your-skill-name
```

### Step 2: Create SKILL.md

Create a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter. `name` and `description` are required. Do not include `author`; this repository does not track skill authors in frontmatter.

```markdown
---
name: your-skill-name
description: Brief description of what the skill does and when to use it.
---

# Your Skill Name

## Overview
Explain what this skill does and when to use it.

Run in the main conversation by default. Delegation can increase usage; obtain
approval for the proposed agent count and scope before using subagents. Reuse
existing approval within its bounds and ask again before expanding that scope.

## Workflow
1. Step one
2. Step two
3. Step three

## Guidelines
- Guideline one
- Guideline two
```

### Step 3: Add Reference Documentation (Optional)

If your skill needs detailed reference documentation:

```bash
mkdir -p skills/your-skill-name/references
```

Add markdown files in the `references/` folder for detailed guides.

### Skill Structure

```
skills/
  your-skill-name/
    SKILL.md              # Required: Skill definition with metadata
    references/           # Optional: Reference documentation
      your-reference.md
    assets/               # Optional: Images, templates, etc.
    scripts/              # Optional: Helper scripts
```

## Validating Your Skill Locally

**Important:** Always validate your skill before pushing to avoid failed PRs.

### Run Validation

```bash
npm run validate
```

This checks:
- Each skill folder has a `SKILL.md` file
- `SKILL.md` has valid YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description`
- `SKILL.md` does not include `author` in frontmatter
- All skills are listed in a plugin's `skills` array in `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`
- `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` matches `plugin-groups.json`
- Codex plugin packages exist under `plugins/` with `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` and bundled skills
- Each plugin name ends with `-skills`

### Expected Output

```
🔍 Validating AI Agent Skills Repository
=========================================

Found X skill(s) in skills/

📁 Validating skills...

📦 Validating marketplace.json...

=========================================
✅ All validations passed! (X valid skills)
```

### If Validation Fails

Fix the reported errors before pushing. Common issues:

| Error | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Missing SKILL.md | Create `skills/your-skill/SKILL.md` |
| No valid YAML frontmatter | Add `---\nname: ...\ndescription: ...\n---` at top of SKILL.md |
| Missing "name" in frontmatter | Add `name: your-skill-name` to frontmatter |
| Missing "description" in frontmatter | Add `description: ...` to frontmatter |
| Author field is present | Remove `author` from frontmatter |
| Skill not in any plugin's skills array | Add the skill to exactly one plugin in `plugin-groups.json`, then run `npm run sync` |
| Codex plugin package is out of sync | Run `npm run sync` to regenerate `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` and `plugins/**` |

### Sync Marketplaces

After changing skills or plugin groups, update generated marketplace and plugin files locally:

```bash
npm run sync
```

This will:
- Scan all skills in `skills/` folder
- Update `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` based on `plugin-groups.json`
- Update `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` based on `plugin-groups.json`
- Regenerate Codex plugin packages under `plugins/`
- Update the skills table in `README.md`

**Note:** Pull request CI checks that generated files are current. Run sync before validating and pushing so your PR does not depend on the merge workflow to fix stale files.

### Update Plugin Groups

If you're adding a new skill or re-organizing skills by domain, update `plugin-groups.json` to assign each skill to a plugin and keep plugin names ending in `-skills`.

Domain guidance:
- Group skills by audience or workflow domain, not by implementation details.
- Keep plugins cohesive; if a skill feels unrelated, create a new plugin instead of expanding the scope.
- Prefer stable, future-proof names (avoid temporary project names).
- Ensure each skill appears in exactly one plugin.
- Keep plugin descriptions short, clear, and action-focused.

After updating `plugin-groups.json`, run `npm run sync` to update the marketplace files and README tables.

## Submitting Your Skill

### Step 1: Validate

```bash
npm run sync
npm run validate
```

Make sure all validations pass.

### Step 2: Commit

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add your-skill-name skill"
```

### Step 3: Push

```bash
git push origin main
```

### Step 4: Create Pull Request

1. Go to the original repository
2. Click "Pull Requests" > "New Pull Request"
3. Select your fork and branch
4. Fill in the PR template
5. Submit

### What Happens Next

1. GitHub Actions runs validation on your PR
2. If validation passes, maintainers review your skill
3. On merge, the marketplace is auto-updated

## Skill Metadata Requirements

### Required Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `name` | Skill identifier (should match folder name, kebab-case) |
| `description` | Clear description of what the skill does and when to use it |

### Example

```yaml
---
name: api-documentation
description: Generate comprehensive API documentation from code. Use when documenting REST APIs, GraphQL endpoints, or RPC services.
---
```

## Quality Guidelines

### Do

- **Clear Purpose**: Solve a specific, well-defined problem
- **Actionable Instructions**: Explain the goal, domain decisions, evidence, and completion criteria; use steps only when their order matters
- **Reference Documentation**: Provide detailed references for complex topics
- **Universal Compatibility**: Write instructions that work across different AI tools
- **Examples**: Include examples where helpful
- **Proportionate Guidance**: Reuse existing authorization and adapt checks to the changed behavior; preserve explicit project limits
- **Consistent Resources**: Update references, templates, adapter prompts, and plugin metadata when changing workflow behavior
- **Delegation Consent**: Run in the main conversation by default; explain usage impact and obtain approval for the proposed agent count and scope, with fresh approval before expansion

### Don't

- Don't create skills that are too narrow or too broad
- Don't duplicate existing skills
- Don't impose arbitrary question counts, confidence scores, skill quotas, or repeated approval gates
- Don't claim improvements on a specific model without evaluation evidence
- Don't include sensitive or proprietary information
- Don't use tool-specific syntax that won't work in other AI tools

## Getting Help

- Open an issue for questions or suggestions
- Check existing skills for examples
- Read [CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md) for AI agent instructions
